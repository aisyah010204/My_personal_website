<h2 style="text-align: center;"><img src="gambar/uia.gif" alt="image of uia"  style="width:200px; height: 200px;"></h2>

<p>My hobby is drawing, and I have enjoyed it since I was 10 years old. I find it relaxing and rewarding, especially when I draw animals, which are my favorite subjects. Creating animal pictures allows me to express my creativity and improve my artistic skills. After I complete my degree, I might continue to pursue art, either as a career or by studying it further.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><img src="gambar/music.jpg" alt="image of music"  style="width:300px; height: 300px;"></h3>

<p>I love listening to pop rock music because of its energy and catchy melodies. However, indie pop is not really my cup of tea, as I prefer a more powerful and upbeat sound. Some of my favorite bands are Novelbright and Day6, both of which are groups known for their emotional lyrics and strong instrumentals. Their music really resonates with me and has become a big part of my daily life.</p>
